# Wish List #

Potential contributors have asked how they can get involved with the Google API Libraries for GWT project.  We are soliciting contributions of all shapes and sizes for the libraries.

Remember, that all contributions must follow the guidelines of the [Making Google API Libraries for GWT Better](MakingGALGWTBetter.md) page.  Specifically keep in mind that all contributions will go through a code review process before they are incorporated, so you will be expected to respond to review comments and resubmit patches as a part of the process.

The following items were gleaned from the issue tracker and informal requests on the mailing list.  Please post to the [Google API Libraries for GWT](http://groups.google.com/group/gwt-google-apis) Google Group if you have suggestions for new ideas you would like to see included in this list.  If there is an issue in the issue tracker for an idea, you can vote for an idea by clicking on the star icon at the top of the issue.
