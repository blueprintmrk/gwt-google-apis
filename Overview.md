#summary Overview of the Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit

# Overview #

The Google API Libraries for Google Web Toolkit is a collection of libraries that provide Java language bindings for popular JavaScript APIs such as the
[Google AJAX Search API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/),
[Gears API](http://code.google.com/apis/gears/),
[Maps API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/),
[Visualization API](http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/), and
[Gadgets](http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/). These libraries make it quick and easy for you to use these JavaScript APIs in your Google Web Toolkit project without having to write custom integration code using JavaScript.
