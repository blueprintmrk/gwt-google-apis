This section discusses how to contribute new code to the project.

The Google API Library for GWT is an adjunct project of the [Google Web Toolkit](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit).  Both are open source projects maintained by Google and other developers and follow the same contributor guidelines.  See [Making GWT Better](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/makinggwtbetter.html) to get started.  This project provides GWT bindings for Google APIs that have been previously released only as JavaScript APIs.
